                Workshops are a great opportunity for your employees or team
                members to apply new ideas to their work by engaging in
                interactive activities and dialogue guided by an expert. In a
                classroom-type setting, participants may use workbooks or other
                learning aides as they share ideas and ask questions as they go
                deeper with material from the original keynote or new
                material.&nbsp;At the intersection of leadership and learning,
                going beyond the keynote is the best way to ensure
                transformational change within any organization.

                Let the research speak for itself. Although training alone
                increases productivity by 22.4%; additional ongoing coaching
                results in productivity gains of 88%. Take a look at how some of
                BigSpeakâ€™s clients have made transformational change in their
                organization by going beyond the keynote with additional
                training.
